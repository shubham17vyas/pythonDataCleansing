This is an academic project I did in python using python modules like beautiful soup, matplotlib, geopy, os, uuid, json. I Scraped the data from data.gov website in csv form. Used it to plot graphs using the modules geopy and matplotlib.


To run the project just download the files and run it using python shell. The data will automatically be downloaded, analysed and will present you with three graphs.
